# The Empress of the Americas  

This is a project was formed by taking Bl Carlo Acuti's site as an example; to demostrate how Mary, as mother of all people, has made herself known in the New World. She, as the Mother of God, brings the Word to the world. As such, she is the centre of the new envagelisation of the world, and will triumph over satan.

> *The Immaculate alone has from God the promise of victory over Satan. She seeks souls that will consecrate themselves entirely to her, that will become in her hands forceful instruments for the defeat of Satan and the spread of God's kingdom.*
> (St Maximilian Kolbe)

## Content  

Obviously, a site like this needs structure to make it more straight forward.

- Marian Doctrine
- American Marian Devitons
- Articles/Blogposts
- About Us
  - I have a feeling I might need this and include some of the info on this README.md


## Technology

That being said, this is also a very interesting technology demo. Below is the planned technology which I plan to use for the project:  

- Firebase
- Typescript
- Astro
- Svelte

## Petition

I pray that Bl Carlo and the Virgin of Guadalupe, both who inspired this, allow a modecum of quality to come to this project. Then, may people see the intersession of the Virgin for the sake of bring us to Her Son, our Lord Jesus.

**Viva la Virgine de Guadalupe.**
